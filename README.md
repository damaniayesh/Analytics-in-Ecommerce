# Introduction
E-commerce analytics involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from an online store to make informed decisions. It encompasses tracking and measuring various key metrics and customer behaviors, such as: Conversion Rate: The percentage of website visitors who complete a desired action (e.g., making a purchase). Cart Abandonment Rate: The proportion of users who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase. Customer Acquisition Cost: The expense incurred to acquire a new customer. Customer Retention Rate: The ability to retain existing customers over time. By leveraging these insights, businesses can optimize marketing strategies, enhance customer experiences, and boost overall profitability 123.

# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to perform RFM analysis based on historical sales data and other relevant features. <br>
**Recency** - How recently did the customer purchase? <br>
**Frequency** - How often do they purchase? <br>
**Monetary** - How much revenue do they generate? <br>
Rank the customers based on their RFM score and segment them based on the score so as to effectively cater them in the future.
